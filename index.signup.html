      <h3 class="info-three">StarWars</h3>
      <p class="info-p"> This photo blog is brought to you by Aaron Rodi. He has been a passionate Star Wars fan since his mother took him to see the Phantom Mennace in theatres at only 8 years old. The year was 1999. He had previously heard of Star Wars, just like every other human, but never really had any interest. After seeing the Phantom Mennace, he knew then that he would be a passionate fan for life. </p>

        <h3 class="info-three">My Favorite Trilogy</h3>
        <p class="info-p"> Everyone has their own opinion on which of the three trilogies are the best. In my opinion, I like the sequal trilogy the most. I may be biased since it't the trilogy that originally started my super fandom. I love the original trilogy but I've always been a sucker for a good back story and that is exactly what the sequals bring to the table. You gotta admit, seeing a young Darth Vader evolve into the evil he became was great to witness. </p>

        <h3 class="info-three">My opinion on the final trilogy</h3>
        <p class="info-p"> Although this may be unwarranted, I wanted to give my honest opinoin on the final trilogy. Visually, all three movies were fantastic. Disney did not hold back on the spectacular visuals which led to a very captivating watch. The story on the other hand, terrible. I feel they basically remade the original trilogy with new main characters and the original characters sprinkled in. The main character rose to power and defeated the most powerful being in the universe, some how, and I could literally go on forever but for everyone's sake, I won't. I will, in fact, continue to watch these because: 1. It's Star Wars. That't is. That's the reason. </p>
