            Discovered as a slave on Tatooine by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker had the potential to
            become one of the most powerful Jedi ever, and was believed by some to be the prophesied Chosen One who
            would bring balance to the Force.

            <br />
            Darth Maul was an Iridonian (or Zabrak), born on Iridonia. At an early age he was trained as a Jedi, but was
            kidnapped by Darth Sidious, who conditioned him to forget everything he had learned from the Jedi. He then
            began to teach him the ways of the Dark Side.
