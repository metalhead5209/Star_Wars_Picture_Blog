                Set ten years after the events of "The Phantom Menace," the Republic continues to be mired in strife and
                chaos. A separatist movement encompassing hundreds of planets and powerful corporate alliances poses new
                threats to the galaxy that even the Jedi cannot stem. These moves, long planned by an as yet unrevealed
                and powerful force, lead to the beginning of the Clone Wars -- and the beginning of the end of the
                Republic.

                t has been three years since the Clone Wars began. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Jedi
                Knight Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from General
                Grievous, the commander of the droid armies, but Grievous escapes. Suspicions are raised within the Jedi
                Council concerning Chancellor Palpatine, with whom Anakin has formed a bond. Asked to spy on the
                chancellor, and full of bitterness toward the Jedi Council, Anakin embraces the Dark Side.
